Classification (Single - Label):-

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Area Under the ROC

(For Multiclass):-

Macro average precision (average of precision of all classes)
Micro average precision (classwise TP and FP and the calculate overall precision)
Weighted average precision (Same as micro, but it is weighted average depending on the number of items in each class)



Regression:- 

Mean absolute error
Mean Squared Error
Root Mean Squared Error
Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error
Mean Percentage Error
Mean Absolute Percentage Error
R2 (Coefficient of determination) - [1 - (sumation(yt-yp)/sumation(yt-ytmean))]



Classification (Multi Label):-

Preciosion@k (P@k) - (Choosing top k predictions, calculating common values between y_true and y_pred and dividing by k)
Average Precision at k (AP@k) - (Calculating P@1 to P@k and taking there average)
Mean average precision at k (MAP@k) - (Average of AP@k)
