Number of bins for Stratified K-fold for regression problem: 

1. Large Dataset:- Divide data into 10, 20,30 bins directly

2. Small Dataset:- Use Sturge's Rule - Number of Bins = 1 + log2(N) (Where N = number of samples)



Cross validation is the first step in doing feature engineering, building models etc.
